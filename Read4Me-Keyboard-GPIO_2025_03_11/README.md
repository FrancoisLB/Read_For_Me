# Read For Me

## Project Overview

This project is the result of a collaboration between the **My Human Kit** association and the **ECAM Louis De Broglie** engineering school. It was carried out as a student project during the first trimester of 2025.

## Project Description

The goal is to create a reading machine capable of acquiring text from an image capture and reading it aloud using speech synthesis.  
The solution runs on a **Raspberry Pi 5**, equipped with:
- a camera,  
- a 4x4 keypad connected via GPIO ports,  
- a USB speaker,  
- a battery.

## Project History

The current version of the project builds on four earlier versions developed during previous events:
- Initiated at **Fabrikarium 2020**: `Read_For_Me (V1)`  
- Further developed at the **Focus Vision** event: `Read_For_Me_V2`  
- Continued during **Fabrikarium 2022**: `Read_For_Me_V3`  
- Another version created at **Hackatech Inria** in January 2023: `Read For Me V4`

## Objectives of Read4Me V5

- **Improve performance**:  
  Reduce processing time from 1 minute to under 20 seconds.

- **Enhance usability**:  
  Redesign the layout and accessibility of controls and components for easier use.

- **Redesign the enclosure**:  
  Make the case more compact and easier to transport.

## Development Context

The student project lasted only two months and involved a team of three people. As a result, time constraints were significant.

After this phase, members of the **My Human Kit** and **Atelier Partag√©** community fablabs resumed the project with support from **Humanlab INRIA**:
- To rework the 3D model of the enclosure and components using **FreeCAD**, in order to provide a version accessible with open-source tools.
- To enhance the documentation of the Python code.
